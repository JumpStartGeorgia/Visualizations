The majority of the data was collected from <a href='http://www.makler.ge'>www.makler.ge</a> between February 2014 and March 2015. Using this data, we calculated the average selling price of flats for 1 square meter in different cities throughout Georgia. This means that the data is based on the seller's price and may vary slightly from the actual selling price. The average income of households in Tbilisi was taken from the National Statistics Office's 2014 Household Survey.",
