  "methodology_text": "Based on <a href='http:www.makler.ge' target='_blank'>makler.ge</a> data, which was collected between  April 2014 and June 2015, we calculated the average apartment price per square meter in various Georgian cities and Tbilisi areas. For Ozurgeti, we had to search for additional adversitements from other sources as the number of ads on makler.ge during this time period was too small. As most of the ads are in USD, we converted the cost to GEL using today’s official exchange rate by the National Bank of Georgia as obtained from <a href='lari.jumpstart.ge' target='_blank'>Lari Explorer API</a>.<p> To calculate the duration of the bank loan, we used the following formula:</p><div class='formula'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log(M) - Log(M - PR/12)<br />N = <span class='line'>───────────────────</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log(1 + R/12)</div>where:<ul><li>N = calculated number of months of loan</li><li>M = monthly payment</li><li>P = loan amount (principal)</li><li>R = loan rate, which is fixed at 9%</li></ul><a href='http://www.had2know.com/finance/how-long-pay-off-loan.html' target='_blank' class='source'>Source for Equation</a>",
