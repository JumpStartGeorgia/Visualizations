      <p>
        For both Proportional and Majoritarian elections in 2012, there are a total of 
        <span style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">10,914</span> ballots unaccounted for.
      </p>
      <ul class="standard">
        <li>
          Proportional - 3,051 missing ballots
        </li>
        <li>
          Majoritarian - 7,863 missing ballots
        </li>

      <h1>How Voting Works in Georgia</h1>
      <ul class="standard">
        <li>
          The procedures that take place on election day are defined by election code
        </li>
        <li>
          People go to polling station
        </li>
        <li>
          People sign in and get ballots

        <li>
          Polling Station staff count all ballots and record the totals on a 'protocol'
        </li>
        <li>
          Protocols are sent to the CEC

        <li>
          CEC does a double-blind data entry

      <h1>Where Problems Can Occur</h1>
      <ul class="standard">
        <li>
          Election code allows special polling stations to be merged into other polling stations for counting
        </li>
        <li>
          People do not turn in ballot(s)
        </li>
        <li>
          Polling station staff miscount
        </li>

    <section>
      <h1>Election Code and Special Polling Stations</h1>
      <ul class="standard">
        <li>
          A special polling station is a prison, military base, hospital or other facility
        </li>
        <li>
          Votes from special polling stations are merged into a parent polling station
        </li>
        <li>
          In a Majoritarian election, there is no way to properly know how many ballots were submitted from the special polling stations compared to the parent polling station, without a court order opening up the official polling station documents
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 2012 Majoritarian election, there were 74 special polling stations whose voting results cannot be properly verified 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>People Might Not Turn in Their Ballot</h1>
      <ul class="standard">
        <li>
          Polling Stations count the signatures of people that received ballots, <em>NOT</em> the total ballots put in the box
        </li>
        <li>
          This means if a person signs for a ballot but does not put it in a box, the ballot is missing

      <div>
        To validate that the ballots were counted correctly, the following equation should be true:
      </div>

      <div>
        <br><br>
        (4 - Ballots Signed For) - (6 - Invalid Ballots Submitted) = SUM(Votes for Each Party)

      <div id="problem-counting-ballots-validation-eq-ex">
        Here is a protocol from Polling Station 1 in Gori.
        For this protocol, the equation turns into:
        <div>
          832 - 32 = (4 + 277 + 11 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 495)

          Above is a snapshot of the spreadsheet for the Proportional election results.

          Notice that the columns correspond directly with the data from the protocol except the spreadsheet does not have a column to record the number of ballets on hand
